## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **Step 1: Configure Environment**
1. Edit the `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```bash
   # Required for testing
   POCKETBASE_URL=http://localhost:8090
   POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@pulse.com
   POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   
   # Optional (for market data)
   ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_key
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret
   ```

### **Step 2: Start PocketBase Server**
```bash
# Start PocketBase backend
./scripts/start-dev-simple.sh
```

This will start PocketBase on `http://localhost:8090`

### **Step 3: Set Up PocketBase Admin**
1. Open browser to: `http://localhost:8090/_/`
2. Create admin account with credentials from your `.env` file
3. The database collections will be created automatically

### **Step 4: Run Flutter App**
Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
# For web development (recommended for testing)
flutter run -d chrome

# For macOS desktop
flutter run -d macos

# For connected mobile device
flutter run
```

### **Step 5: Test the System**
The app will start with a **Test Setup Page** that allows you to:
- ✅ Test PocketBase connection
- ✅ Create user accounts
- ✅ Sign in/out functionality
- ✅ Create and view trading signals
- ✅ Validate all core features

## 📱 User Flow Testing

### **Authentication Testing**
1. Use the test page to create a new account
2. Sign in with the account
3. Test sign out functionality
4. Try OAuth (Google/Apple) if configured

### **Signal Testing**
1. Sign in first
2. Click "Create Test Signal" to add sample data
3. Click "Load Signals" to view all signals
4. Check subscription tier filtering works

### **Database Verification**
- Visit PocketBase admin: `http://localhost:8090/_/`
- Check `users`, `signals`, `watchlistItems` collections
- Verify data is being created correctly

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **3-Tier User System**
```
Free Tier     → Historical signal summaries
Premium Tier  → Real-time static signals ($19.99/month)
Dynamic Tier  → Live signal upgrades ($4.99 per signal)
```

### **Database Collections**
- **users**: Authentication, subscriptions, profiles
- **signals**: Trading signals with tier-based access
- **watchlistItems**: User watchlists
- **signalUpgrades**: Dynamic signal purchases
- **signalUpdates**: Real-time signal updates
- **userNotifications**: App notifications

### **Technology Stack**
- **Backend**: PocketBase (SQLite) + JavaScript hooks
- **Frontend**: Flutter (iOS/Android/Web)
- **State Management**: Riverpod
- **Navigation**: Go Router
- **Real-time**: PocketBase subscriptions

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### **For Backend Changes**
1. Modify PocketBase hooks in `pocketbase/hooks/`
2. Update collections schema in `pocketbase/migrations/`
3. Restart PocketBase server

### **For Frontend Changes**
1. Edit Flutter code in `lib/`
2. Use hot reload for instant updates
3. Test with the test setup page

### **For New Features**
1. Add new collections/migrations if needed
2. Update PocketBase service methods
3. Create UI components
4. Test end-to-end functionality

## 🧪 Next Development Steps

### **Immediate (Ready to build)**
1. **Replace Test Page** with proper splash/onboarding
2. **Implement Real Signals**: Connect to Alpaca API
3. **Add Payment Integration**: Stripe for dynamic signals
4. **Build Signal Details**: Full signal view with charts

### **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**
1. **Authentication UI**: Login/register screens
2. **Dashboard**: Home screen with signal cards
3. **Signal Generation**: Basic ML signal creation
4. **Push Notifications**: Firebase messaging

### **Medium-term (1-2 months)**
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration
2. **Dynamic Signals**: Live update system
3. **Payment System**: Stripe integration
4. **App Store Deployment**: iOS/Android publish

### **Your Advantages**
- **Cost-effective**: PocketBase reduces backend costs vs Firebase/Supabase
- **Self-hosted**: Full control over your data and infrastructure
- **Scalable**: Can handle significant user growth
- **Multi-platform**: Single codebase for iOS/Android/Web

### **Deployment Options**
- **Development**: Local PocketBase + Flutter web
- **Staging**: VPS/cloud server with PocketBase
- **Production**: Kubernetes/Docker deployment
- **Mobile**: App Store + Google Play

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **PocketBase won't start**: Check port 8090 is free
2. **Flutter errors**: Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
3. **Connection issues**: Verify PocketBase URL in .env
4. **Auth problems**: Check admin panel user creation

### **Getting Help**
